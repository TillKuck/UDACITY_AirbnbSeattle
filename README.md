# Navigating the Emerald City: Seattle’s Airbnb Hosting Blueprint

Welcome to the enchanting city of Seattle, a place where the Space Needle graces the skyline, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, and the possibilities for Airbnb hosts are as diverse as the neighborhoods themselves. Each corner holds distinct opportunities and challenges for hosts. From the iconic Pike Place Market to the trendy Capitol Hill, we’ll explore which areas shine the brightest for hosting success. And now, let’s embark on our journey by addressing four pivotal questions that lie at the heart of profitable hosting in Seattle:

1. Which neighborhoods are best for hosting?
2. How do prices and availability fluctuate throughout the year?
3. What attributes influence the price per night the most?
4. How do you become a Superhost?
In order to answer these questions I utilized the Airbnb Seattle 2017 datasets containing the following data:

**Calendar**: including listing id and the price and availability for that day
**Listings**: including full descriptions and average review score

### 1. Which neighborhoods are best for hosting?
Understanding the unique characteristics of Seattle’s neighborhoods is not just about finding a place to host; it’s about discovering the heartbeat of the city and aligning your hosting strategy with the distinct preferences of potential guests. In our exploration, we will analyze essential factors such as price per night, reviews per month, and location rating, ensuring you make an informed decision that aligns with both your hosting goals and the desires of your future guests.

#### Price

Let’s start by looking at the average price a host can yield in each neighborhood. The following plot shows the top 20 boroughs in terms of price.

Neighborhoods with highest prices: West Queen Anne (USD 188), Alki (USD 172), Pioneer Square (USD 169)
#### Reviews per Month

Next, reviews per month signal how frequently guests stay in Airbnbs in each neighborhood. Above we can see the 20 most frequented areas.

Most frequented Neighborhoods: Pike Market (3.5), Mid-Beacon Hill (3.0) and Whittier Heights (2.9)
#### Location Rating

Finally, location rating shows how popular each neighborhood is perceived. Above, you can see the top 20 neighborhoods.

Most popular neighborhoods: Pike Market (9.91), Alki (9.89) and Adams(9.88)
Conclusion: After carefully considering price, reviews per month and location rating of all neighborhoods it is best to host either in Pike Market, Alki or Pioneer Square.

### 2. How do prices and availability fluctuate throughout the year?
Another interesting factor is the price and availability over the year. Usually, the travel industry underlies seasonal volatility, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the same for Airbnb in Seattle.


As we can see from the graph above, there is a clear seasonal trend in availability and price. The price per night increases from USD 120 in January to USD 160 in July, where it remains stable until September before it decreases to USD 135. Interestingly, there are weekly price spikes, with weekends having the highest prices.

If we look at availability, available units rise from 1800 in January to 2800 in April. Then we see a steep drop at the end of March, beginning of April. Another steep drop occurs in July. Two events that might have impacted availability could have been the Seattle Restaurant Week in April and Seattle International Film Festival in July. Contrary to these availability drops, there were no significant increases in price.

Conclusion: Price-wise, peak season seems to be from June until September. Availability is highly volatile throughout the year and lowest in April until September if we only consider warmer seasons. Hence, hosting from April to September shows to be most profitable, especially when special events are happening.

### 3. What attributes influence the price per night the most?
Next, let’s look at the features that have the highest influence on price. This analysis can be especially insightful as you directly see how your Dollars spend impact the price per night you can charge. To do that, I ran a Bayesian Ridge regression. According to the R² score, the data at hand explains 63.9% of the variance in price. Below you can see the importance of each feature in Dollars.


Feature Importance of Regression Analysis
Looking over the top 5 features, we can see that neighborhood Pioneer Square (USD 43), neighborhood West Queen Anne (USD 41), neighborhood Pike Market (USD 34), entire home/apartment (USD 34) and the number of bathrooms (USD 32 each) impact the price per night the most.

If we look at the bigger picture and only consider categories, we see that neighborhood has the highest influence on price as it shows up 13 times in the top 20 features. Other big influencers are room type, number of bathrooms, host response time, property type, number of bedrooms and whether the host is a superhost.

Conclusion: If we could configure the perfect Airbnb, theoretically it would be an apartment on a boat located in Pioneer Square, having 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with the host being a superhost, the Airbnb could be offered for USD 236. Not bad, right?

### 4. How do you become a Superhost?
Now, that we know what neighborhood, season and features are most relevant, it would also be interesting to know how to become a superhost as they are perceived to be the elite hosters on the platform and enjoy the highest reputation. So, let’s have a look at the correlation matrix below.


Correlation Matrix of listing features
The first column shows the correlation associated with being a superhost. We can see that reviews per month have the highest correlation with a correlation of 0.27, followed by rating (0.25), number of reviews (0.25), cleanliness (0.24) and value (0.23).

Conclusion: The most important features correlated with being a superhost show that it is important to host guests frequently, with a long hosting history and get high overall ratings as well as good ratings for cleanliness. So, better start sooner than later to build your Airbnb legacy.

### Summing up
In this article, we took a look at Airbnb data from 2017 to find a blueprint for how to start your hosting business in Seattle successfully.

1. Choose a neighborhood that promises high prices per night combined with good location ratings and is frequently booked such as Pike Market, Alki or Pioneer Square.
2. Be aware of the peak season from April to September during which you can charge a premium. Also be aware of events like Seattle Seahawk games, the Seattle Restaurant Week in April and the Seattle International Film Festival in July that drive demand and therefore prices!
3. Our regression analysis clearly shows the right neighborhood makes ~25% of the price. Offering a whole apartment, multiple bed- and bathrooms and further benefits drive the price per night.
4. Hosting many people and having higher ratings will increase your chances of becoming a Superhosts.
