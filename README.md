### Project Motivation
Welcome to the enchanting city of Seattle, a place where the Space Needle graces the skyline, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, and the possibilities for Airbnb hosts are as diverse as the neighborhoods themselves. Each corner holds distinct opportunities and challenges for hosts. From the iconic Pike Place Market to the trendy Capitol Hill, we’ll explore which areas shine the brightest for hosting success. And now, let’s embark on our journey by addressing four pivotal questions that lie at the heart of profitable hosting in Seattle:

**1. Which neighborhoods are best for hosting?**
**2. How do prices and availability fluctuate throughout the year?**
**3. What attributes influence the price per night the most?**
**4. How do you become a Superhost?**

### File Descriptions
In order to answer these questions I utilized the Airbnb Seattle 2017 datasets containing the following data:

**Calendar**: including listing id and the price and availability for that day  
**Listings**: including full descriptions and average review score

### Results
The results and main conclusions can be found in the Jupyter Notebook "airbnb_seattle.ipynb".
